    "<p>Singapore is a very small but well-developed country in Southeast Asia. It has only one city, named Singapore, which has gained a reputation for holding first Trump-Kim Summit. Long before that, Singapore is always being a very international city where most regional headquarters for top 500 fortune companies are located. According to the report of Department of Statistics Singapore, the proportion of Singapore citizens in the total population is only 61.56% in 2018, and for Permanent Residents and foreigners, it is 9.26% and 29.16% respectively. For people moving to Singapore, settling down and finding the perfect place to live would be the first thing to be considered.</p>"

    "<p>However, the current property recommendation system in Singapore is not as perfect as it should be.  Generally speaking, if someone decides to live in a new place, before contacting a specific property agent, he or she should clearly know that which location is a preference, as different districts usually have different agents. This question is actually very difficult to be answered for residents in Singapore, especially those newcomer foreigners.  Singapore has no rural areas, and the mature communities always have convenient transportation and life facilities. If your work location is in the CBD like Raffles Place, even if you live in the westmost or east most areas of Singapore, it may only take an hour from your home to work place. If you can bear the distance for 30 minutes’ public transportation, you still have too many choices about where to live.  As a result, region factor cannot be in the first place to classify costumers in local property market. </p>"

    "<p>In this report, I try to build a new property recommendation system for local agents. I believe customers’ different needs on life-styles is beyond location preference in most cases in Singapore. For example, parents with young kids would take the distance to elite primary schools on as their priority, while foreign students and young employees maybe enjoy a rapid and modern life-style, and they might choose somewhere close to MRT, coffee shops and gyms.  So, I suggest we should firstly cluster properties types in the whole city (which is equal to the whole country) by differences of customers’ needs, then add that customers’ detailed preferences to decide which regions and what blocks are the best choice for them. Over eighty percent of Singapore residents choose to live in HDB (Housing and Development Board) blocks, and the data about those HDB blocks is very easy to get from government supported websites. As a result, I narrowed down my research scope, and focus on HDB only. </p>"
